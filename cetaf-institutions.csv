Ecological functions and ecosystem services, so intensively studied today, are provided by organisms; therefore, their full understanding, quantification, monitoring, and management requires knowledge about the underlying systematics.', 'The RF Biodiversity and Ecosystem Health focuses on understanding and managing the World´s species and ecosystems under global change. The research activity (RA) Medical Biodiversity contributes to the global One Health initiative by investigating vector-borne diseases and parasitology. The RA Long-term Ecosystem Dynamics represents a “traditional” research activity with typical long-term monitoring aspects and a key competence in long-term data analyses.', 'The three research activities of RF Biodiversity and Climate, i.e. Evolution and Climate, Biodiversity Dynamics and Climate, and Adaptation and Climate represent the different time scales over which we analyse how biodiversity interacts with its environment from Earth’s geologic history to the impact of our industrialized global society. These research activities complement the RA Ecosystem services and climate, which, in cooperation with the Institut für sozial-ökologischeForschung (ISOE), studies the social-ecological dimensions of biodiversity and climate change.', 'RF Biodiversity and Earth System Dynamics analyzes key periods of Earth’s history to derive “lessons from the past“, particularly with respect to the mutual impact of biodiversity on evolution – biotic and abiotic – of the “Earth system”. Further, it studies the impact of environmental change and increased anthropogenic sea use on sedimentary environments of coastal and shelf seas as well as on non-tropical shallow- and deep-water biosedimentary systems and carbon cycling. A third focus on Human Evolution and Paleoenvironment complements these longer time scales as it addresses the evolution of humans in the light of the multifaceted interactions with their paleoenvironment.']","Marine Biodiversity – Edt.

Important part of the herbarium is also extensive collection of the genera Hieracium and Pilosella by Alois Zlatník. Internationally important collection is that by Czech botanist František Nábělek (1884-1965). He studied botany under Professor Richard von Wettstein at Vienna University, Austria. Shortly after finishing his studies he visited SW Asia, where he collected plants from March 1909 until November 1910. During this time he visited the area of the current Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Bahrein, Iran and Turkey. Along with Joseph Bornmüller and Heinrich Handel-Mazzetti, Nábělek was one of the most important contributors towards the knowledge of the flora of this area after the publication of Boissier's Flora Orientalis. Results of his studies were published in five parts of his work Iter Turcico-Persicum (Nábělek, 1923-1929), where he described four new genera, 78 species, 69 varieties and 38 formas. His extensive herbarium from this area contains 6775 specimens (altogether 4171 collection numbers).

Publication of electronic Flora of Slovakia', '3. Digitalisation of herbarium collections']","1. Laboratory of Molecular Systematics In this laboratory we generate data addressing scientific questions of taxonomy, phylogeny, phylogeography and related evolutionary processes across different groups of vascular and non-vascular plants. Methods applied are focused on the study of differences and changes on the DNA level among organisms using several methods such as AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism), SSRs (microsatellites – simple repetitions) or sequencing of selected loci. Most of the currently used molecular methods are based on variations of the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and the analyses of the relevant products. The laboratory is also equipped for DNA extraction from plant material dried in silica gel or from herbarium specimens. In case when direct sequencing of specific loci is problematic, we use methods such as SSCP (Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism) or cloning of PCR products into the bacterial cells, separating different alleles from diploid and especially from polyploid individuals. Currently we implement also new methods based on the NGS (Next Generation Sequencing), such as a Hyb-Seq and RAD-Seq. Here we are sequencing only selected loci and not the whole genome, which decreases price per sample and gives the opportunity to sequence more individuals. The laboratory of molecular systematics possess all necessary equipment for standard methods used in molecular systematics such as DNA extraction, PCR based methods (PCR-RFLP, AFLP, SSR), DNA purification, as well as cloning of PCR products (centrifuges, mixer mill, PCR thermocyclers, thermoblocks, incubators, PCR and flow boxes, spectrophotometer and fluorometer, temperature controlled electrophoresis apparatus, electrophoresis power supplies, blue light and UV-transilluminators with imaging system, etc.). The Institute owns or hires licenses for all relevant programs needed for molecular data evaluation (Geneious, PAUP, MacClade, SYN-TAX, SAS, DAx). 2. Laboratory of karyology and flow cytometry Regarding karyological research, the Institute possesses a karyological laboratory equipped by a microscope Axioscope 2 (Zeiss) and two flow cytometers equipped by a green laser with488 nm excitation wave and an HBO mercury arc lamp for UV excitation, respectively. Flow cytometers allow to detect relative (DNA ploidy level) as well as absolute DNA amount in plant material. Two cytometers running in parallel offer a possibility of simultaneous measurements of relative and absolute DNA amounts of the same sample and thus i.a. estimation of the proportion of AT/GC bases in the studied genome. 3. Morphometric laboratory All instrumental and software equipment required for the application of multivariate morphometrics is available. This consists of several high-quality stereomicroscopes (Olympus SZ 61) with digital cameras to output image to PC, and A3 scanner allowing observation, digitalization and subsequent evaluation of the investigated material. Software accessories comprise licenses of statistical programs and packages (SAS, SYN-TAX) needed for evaluation of the biostatistical data. 4. Mycological laboratory The analytical, genomic DNA extraction mycological laboratory serves for the analyses of lichen secondary chemistry and for the extraction of nucleic acids; innoculation and cultivation mycological laboratory for fungal culture preparation, and algological laboratory. 5. Mycological, phytopathological and algological cultivation labs The laboratories serve for isolation of the material from the substrate (microscopic fungi from host plant tissues, algae and cyanobacteria from water), inoculation and cultivation of the material for further analyses (e. g. molecular analyses). 6. Molecular Laboratory of Plant Physiology In our laboratories we use mainly the methods as a ROS determination, electrophoresis, root respiration, determination of different enzymes activities, methods for obtaining physiological status of investigated plants, gene expression and semiquantitative RT-PCR. 7. Pedological laboratory Chemical analyses of soil samples serve to complement datasets gathered for studies in plant communities. The results represent additional datasets for characterization of ecological requirements of particular plant assamblages.",,,,Slovakian Consortium: Slovak National Taxonomic Facility (NaTAF),Non-University state research institution,Department of Non-Vascular Plants Department of Vascular Plant Taxonomy Department of Geobotany Department of Plant Physiology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Biologia http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/biolog,,,,,

The research also benefits from the presence of a world-leading authority in phylogenetic methods.', 'NRM leads and participates in national and international monitoring programmes that study environmental contaminants and their effects in terrestrial and marine environments. These studies on levels of environmental contaminants in wildlife cover of the longest time-spans in the world. So do the associated time-series of frozen tissues in the continuously and actively developed Environmental Specimen Bank. The effects of exposure to pollutants on the reproductive and endocrine systems in large marine mammals and links with potential population levels are analysed. Other topics dealt with under this theme concern, bird migration, pollen allergenes and biochemical and geochemical processes of organic substances in the environment. Expertise and collections supporting the research under this theme are unique in Europe.']",,,http://www.nrm.se/ommuseet/verksamhetochorganisation/arsredovisning.180.html,See http://www.nrm.se/english/researchandcollections/researchlibraries.6651_...,,,,,,,,,,"['Systematic research', 'Digitization of collections', 'Developing collections database']","['Collections management standards and practices', 'Access and benefit-sharing routines', 'Developing next phase of the Synthesys project']",,,,"Website access to some collection databases with images, virtual exhibitions:",,,"Director of the Museum – Research & Collection Division (Per Ericson, Director) with seven departments (directorate, bioinformatics and genetics, botany, zoology, geoscience, paleobiology, environmental research and monitoring).

Digital: The digital revolution is transforming how science is done, how information is shared and how people engage with the natural world and the process of scientific discovery. We embrace these changes to reinvent how we make our collection and expertise available to scientific and general audiences worldwide: • Big, open data: Deliver a programme of large-scale digitisation to make our collection available to everyone • Global virtual communities: Build online communities and our NHM membership scheme around our three big narratives and issue an engaging, topical stream of information, news and commentary • Technology innovation: Create platforms to enhance the experience of our visitors prior to, during and after their visit, develop a virtual forum that complements what we offer members and other groups and expand our commercial revenue streams', '2. Citizen Science: A longstanding appreciation of the natural world provides an extraordinary starting point to engage audiences with contemporary science. We want to use regional networks to increase Britain’s capacity in scientific, learning and curatorial disciplines. We will raise the visibility and impact of our activities across Britain, including at our site at Tring, by developing collaborative projects: • UK biodiversity and citizen science: Create tools to monitor UK biodiversity, and become a centre for developing UK activities that engage audiences with the natural world through public participation in citizen science and touring exhibitions • Learning outreach: Lead a programme working with national and regional organisations to enhance science learning in schools and beyond • Opening up the nation’s collections: Forge a collaborative network of natural history collections, sharing expertise and best practice and developing shared collection use and storage facilities.', '3. International societal challenges: We must act at a global level to tackle the most important scientific and societal challenges faced by the natural world and humanity. We will play a more visible leadership role to forge international partnerships and pursue large-scale scientific, public and commercial initiatives: • Partnerships and leadership: Pursue an international programme of activities and exhibitions, engaging a global audience in our three big narratives and developing new commercial opportunities to better exploit the Museum’s brand, collection and expertise • Next-generation biodiversity discovery: Lead an international consortium to develop a twenty-first-century toolkit for the discovery of biological diversity and apply this to explore hyper-diverse systems • Scientific grand challenges: Use our collection and expertise to tackle questions of fundamental relevance to science and society, including environmental change, the spread of diseases and the supply of food and scarce minerals']","['1. Big, open data and digital activities: This includes digitisation of major parts of our collection to make it openly available to public and scientific audiences worldwide, which will remain a prevailing theme for the NHM due to the scale and on-going development of the collection.

Infrastructure: The next 25 years will witness the transformation of our South Kensington building, one of the UK's most iconic, which has stood for nearly 150 years. At each stage of the transformation we will improve the fabric and infrastructure of our estate to meet the needs of our activities and audiences. We will also invest in systems and technology that make us more effective at managing information and mobilising our data to enrich global scientific knowledge."", '3. People: An expert and passionate community of people work, study and volunteer at the Museum. Our people provide the foundation for all our activities.
